<h2>MD5 Hash in Ruby</h2>
<p class="publish_date">30 Apr 2008</p>
<p>The top three google links I got for this seemed to require a lot of junk I didn&#8217;t think I needed.  I kept searching and found that it is exactly as ridiculously simple as I have come to expect from Ruby:</p>

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
require 'md5'
puts Digest::MD5.hexdigest("This is what I want to hash")
</pre>
