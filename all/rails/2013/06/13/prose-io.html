<h2 id="proseio_for_static_github_sites">Prose.io for Static github Sites</h2>

<p>This is a jekyll blog. I’m composing this post at <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>. I’m not even sure if I’m doing it correctly but if you are reading this I eventually figured it out.</p>

<p>Prose lets you auth with github and edit your content. It’s a little bit like working in a CMS like wordpress but with all the benefits of a statically generated site. I suppose once I save and publish this post it’ll get commited to my repository and the jekyll site generation will happen.</p>

<p>Here goes nothing</p>

<p>Ok, I clicked “Unpublished” and it changed to “Published” - I checked github and didn’t see anything - then I clicked the icon of the floppy disk to save. It prompted me for a commit message and now I see it on github.</p>
