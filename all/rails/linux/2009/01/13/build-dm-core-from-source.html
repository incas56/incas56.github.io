<h2>Building dm-core from source</h2>
<p class="publish_date">13 Jan 2009</p>
<p>In the current gem version of dm-types 0.9.9 the <span class="caps">YAML</span> uses primitive &#8220;String&#8221; with a size of 65535.  This is an issue when using mySQL and utf-8.  The issue was fixed by Tony Mann (<a href="http://github.com/sam/dm-more/commit/d2925e66ad76db4231f2f79fd465aec75680bc3d">here</a>).</p>
<p>So until this 0.9.10 version is released my deployments will need to build dm-types from source.  dm-types 0.9.10 requires dm-core 0.9.10 so that needs to be built from source as well.</p>
<p>Here is how to install from the latest source on github:</p>
<pre class="terminal">
~/ $ gem install rspec bcrypt-ruby json hoe --no-rdoc --no-ri
~/ $ mkdir sources
~/ $ cd sources
~/sources $ git clone git://github.com/sam/dm-core.git
~/sources $ git clone git://github.com/sam/dm-more.git
~/sources $ cd dm-core
~/sources/dm-core $ rake package &amp;&amp; rake install
~/sources/dm-core $ cd ../dm-more/dm-types
~/sources/dm-core/dm-types $ rake package &amp;&amp; rake install
</pre>
<p>I tried freezing the gems into my rails app a few weeks ago but I didn&#8217;t have good success.</p>
