<h2>If I had Geeky Friends</h2>
<p class="publish_date">01 Jan 2009</p>
<p>I found a terribly minor bug in the datamapper gemspec file that was causing me an issue.  I got on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and the guys told me to fork, fix, and send a pull request.  I did and then my commit was pushed to github and my picture was on the <a href="http://github.com/sam/dm-core/tree/master">sam/dm-core</a> main page because I was the last &#8220;author.&#8221;  It was like a brush with fame.  I told #datamapper that I wished I had geeky friends so I could tell them.</p>
<p>My commit is still immortalized <a href="http://github.com/sam/dm-core/commit/7a05110be7d59f23eea47161fbbcb66a1fbd2124">here.</a> :)</p>
