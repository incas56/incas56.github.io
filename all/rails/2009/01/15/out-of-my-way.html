<p class="publish_date">15 Jan 2009</p>
<p>I was just talking with a coworker today telling her about how archaic design patterns seem after working in Ruby On Rails &#8211; how you don&#8217;t need to solve &#8220;coding&#8221; problems, you just write code to solve your business problem&#8230; it gets out of your way so you can do your work.</p>
<p>How did I plan to spend my evening? in c# solving business problems.</p>
<p>How did I spend my evening? pulling out my hair trying to solve code problems.</p>
<p>2AM with nothing but half finished methods to show for it.  How much more will I take before porting spokt to Rails?</p>
