<h2>Quicksilver for OS X</h2>
<p class="publish_date">29 Sep 2009</p>
<p>I started using Quicksilver last week and I&#8217;m starting to like it a lot.  In it&#8217;s simplest use case it is an application launcher that doesn&#8217;t require using the mouse.  But it&#8217;s more powerful feature is that it lets me complete common tasks in a direct manner.</p>
<h3>Scenario: Email something to somebody</h3>
<p>I think the normally accepted steps to email a file to someone as an attachment are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open your mail application (Gmail, Apple Mail, Thunderbird)</li>
	<li>Compose a new email (Command+N or click &#8220;New&#8221;)</li>
	<li>Click attach, browse to file (Or navigate in Finder and drag it in)</li>
	<li>Enter a &#8220;to&#8221; address and subject</li>
	<li>Click Send</li>
</ul>
<p>This is application-oriented computing as opposed to task-oriented computing. Task-oriented computing would be using a computer to accomplish tasks&#8230; you shouldn&#8217;t use a computer to use applications you should use it to accomplish tasks.</p>
<p>These don&#8217;t need to be <em>useful</em> tasks, but the goal isn&#8217;t to &#8220;use email&#8221; it&#8217;s to &#8220;read messages&#8221;, the goal isn&#8217;t &#8220;use spokt.com&#8221; it&#8217;s to &#8220;catch up with my family&#8221;, it&#8217;s not &#8220;using Excel&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;calculating your monthly budget&#8221;.  The closer computers get to allowing us to think about performing tasks and doing them without thinking in terms of applications the more powerful computers will become to us.</p>
<p>Using Quicksilver is true task-oriented computing but I think it is a step in the right direction. The &#8220;tasks&#8221; are kind of like sentences.  In this example I want to email (verb) a document (direct object) to you (indirect object).  Okay I don&#8217;t want to get into the &#8220;grammar&#8221; of it because it might make it seem more difficult than it is.</p>
<p>Here is how you would do it using Quicksilver:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Command+Space to launch Quicksilver</li>
	<li>type in the file name (it auto completes)</li>
	<li>tab to the next box and type what you want to do &#8216;em&#8217; (auto completes: &#8220;Email To&#8230;&#8221;!)</li>
	<li>Since this &#8220;verb&#8221; requires a recipient you tab to the third box and it auto completes from your addressbook.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total keys pressed: 14<br />
Total Mouse movements required: 0<br />
Total Number Windows re arranged: 0<br />
Total Time: about 10 seconds but I&#8217;ll get faster</p>
<ul>
	<li>Command+Space (2)</li>
	<li>M U L + tab (4)</li>
	<li>E M A + tab (4)</li>
	<li>D A N H + return (4)</li>
</ul>
<p>How long does it take you to email a document?</p>
<p>Other Quicksilver tasks I&#8217;ve found useful: moving and copying files, tweeting (<a href="http://en.deadbeaf.org/2007/12/13/quicksilver-twitter-plugin/">plugin required</a>), compressing files, and launching terminal windows to rails folders.</p>
