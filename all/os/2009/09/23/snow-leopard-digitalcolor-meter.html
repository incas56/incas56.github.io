<h2>OS X Snow Leopard Enhancement</h2>
<p class="publish_date">23 Sep 2009</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Snow Leopard and its great but day to day use is not very different from Leopard. Today I stumbled on an enhancement that made me giddy.</p>

<p>I use the DigitalColor Meter to pull colors out of images to use in css styleheets. Open it up, cursor over the color you want, Command+Shift+C to get it on your clip board, and Command+V to paste it into your stylesheet. It works fine but it pastes the colors in quotes with spaces (e.g. &quot;#00 C3 01 &quot;).  So you have to delete the dumb quotes and spaces. (Sure, I dislike them but they are really called <a href="http://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/fyti/smartquotes.htm">&#8216;dumb quotes&#8217;</a>)</p>
<p>I pasted a color today and reached for the delete key when I noticed the hex had been pasted without spaces and quotes. #0490D4 &#8211; Did that really just happen? I tried again and <span class="caps">YES</span>!</p>
<p>Could a human really get giddy over such a small change? Yes.</p>
<p>In somewhat related Snow Leopard and color trivia I changed my background color here from #212121 to #373737 to compensate for the default gamma change.</p>
