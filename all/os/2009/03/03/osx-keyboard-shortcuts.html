<h2>Reason #39,922 OS X is Great</h2>
<p class="publish_date">03 Mar 2009</p>
<p>OS X is great.  It might be easy to use but that&#8217;s not why I love it.  I love the <span class="caps">POWER</span>.  A small example of this power is the rich keyboard shortcuts it provides.  You have the standards: Command+Tab for application switching, Command+S for Save, Command+P for Print, Command+W for closing a window, Command+Q for quitting an application.  The list goes on with Command+~ for switching windows within an application and Command+Shift+] or Command+Shift+[ for switching through tabs within a window.</p>
<p>Apple publishes standard keyboard shortcuts and application developers are supposed to adhere to them.  Sometimes developers fail to include these keyboard shortcuts in their applications or choose their own non-standard variations.  While I suppose there may be good reasons for straying from the path it is too bad for users who don&#8217;t want to learn a new set of commands.  Lucky for us we are using OS X and can override their non-standard shortcuts with our own using keyboard preferences pane.</p>

<p>Now I can switch tabs in Textmate with the same keys I use in Terminal, Safari, and Firefox.</p>
