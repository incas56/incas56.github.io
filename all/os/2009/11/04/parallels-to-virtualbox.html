<h2>Quitting Parallels for VirtualBox</h2>
<p class="publish_date">04 Nov 2009</p>
<p>I used to love parallels for running windows, now it seems slow and overpriced. I&#8217;d been using VirtualBox for linux instances and it&#8217;s great. I upgraded to snow leopard for $29 and Parallels 3 is unsupported &#8211; they wanted $50 to upgrade to Parallels 4. That&#8217;s not the kind of path I want to be on.  I decided to convert my windows instance to VirtualBox.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Convert Image</h3>
<p>I followed these steps to use vmware to <a href="http://benfrain.com/notepad/2009/03/osx-converting-parallels-or-vmware-to.html">convert hdd into something usable by virtualbox</a></p>
<h3>Step 2: Fail</h3>
<p>I went to boot and it didn&#8217;t work. Hung loading drivers &#8211; boot to safe mode hung after agp440.sys, disable agp440.sys and it hangs on mup.sys.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Disable Everything &amp; Enable IO <span class="caps">APIC</span></h3>
<p>An important tenet to troubleshooting any problem you should be careful to change one thing at a time.  I am not a careful troubleshooter &#8211; I like to take shortcuts first then careful later. In VirtualBox I disabled the following: Audio, Network, Ports (<span class="caps">USB</span>) and under &#8220;System&#8221; I checked the &#8220;Enable IO <span class="caps">APIC</span>&#8221;. I was then able to boot.</p>
<p>After installing Guest Add-Ons I started turning things back on one-at-a-time and now everything is back on and when I uncheck &#8220;Enable IO <span class="caps">APIC</span>&#8221; the VM doesn&#8217;t boot, so perhaps that was the problem the whole time but I can&#8217;t tell because I tried a shortcut.</p>
