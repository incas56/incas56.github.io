<p>Sometimes I&#8217;m greeted by this message in terminal:</p>

<p>One of my projects uses cron to schedule tasks and so some test data got into my crontab file. Ok, I go delete the tasks out of crontab and delete my messages.  This comes up so rarely that I forget how to delete the messages and I usually have trouble opening crontab on my first try since textmate is my default editor.</p>
<p>Set nano as my editor by issuing this command:</p>
<pre name="code">
$ export EDITOR='nano'
$ crontab -e
</pre>
<p>Then use Ctrl+K to quickly delete all the lines in the file, Ctrl+O to save the file, Ctrl+X to exit.</p>
<p>Now time to delete all the mail:<br />
<pre name="code">
