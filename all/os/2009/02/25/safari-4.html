<h2>Safari 4 beta: One Suggestion and One Tip</h2>
<p class="publish_date">25 Feb 2009</p>
<p>You can read elsewhere how fast Safari 4 is.  I just have one suggestion regarding the &#8220;Top Sites&#8221; feature: the button should toggle like the booksmark button next to it.  One click: show top sites, click again: show the page you were on before you clicked.</p>

<p>Note: Currently you <em>can</em> click the back button if you need to get back.</p>
<p>Tip: If you want to re-order your tabs you have to grab the tab by the little grippy part:</p>
