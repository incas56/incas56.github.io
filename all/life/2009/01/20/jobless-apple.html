<h2>Jobless Apple: Take 2</h2>
<p class="publish_date">20 Jan 2009</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know Steve Jobs.  I don&#8217;t know how sick he may be but let&#8217;s look at the worst case scenario for Apple investors: Steve Jobs is unable to return to Apple computers.</p>
<p>I think the common reasoning goes something like this:</p>
<p>Observations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jobs started Apple and it kind of changed the world</li>
	<li>Jobs wasn&#8217;t at Apple and it almost died.</li>
	<li>Jobs came back and it&#8217;s been amazing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: Apple without Steve Jobs sucks.</p>
<p>I submit that if Jobs were not healthy enough to return to Apple would be very different than what transpired before.  In 1986 Jobs was ousted.  The company leadership didn&#8217;t agree with him and so they got rid of him.  If Jobs were unable to return Apple would try to continue with his vision.</p>
