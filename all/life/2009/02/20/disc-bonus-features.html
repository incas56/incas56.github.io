<h2>Please Stop With the Crappy Bonus Features</h2>

<p>Dear Movie Makers,</p>
<p>We donâ€™t want to read a bunch of information, bios, histories, and stories on our movies.  We want to watch the movie and see a blooper reel.  Reading on a television screen is the ocular equivalent to fingernails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Public</p>
