<h2>Debussy &amp; Bartok</h2>

<blockquote>&#8220;Everything he does is wrong,&#8221; said one of his teachers, &#8220;but he is wrong in a talented way.&#8221; Claude Debussy went to the Paris Conservatory and studied there for eleven contention-filled years, questioning and breaking away from all the rules of the past. &#8220;Why must dissonant chords always be resolved?&#8221; Debussy asked, and when he was not given a satisfactory answer, he began to experiment with a chromaticism, modal technique, the whole tone and pentatonic scales, the avoiding of a definite key, and using chords that tended to produce vagueness of tonality. With his fastidious ear he had a natural affinity for the exotic and old as well as the most avant-garde. He acquired a reputation as an iconoclast, violating all rules, and it is not surprising that some years later the twentieth-century revolution in music began in France with Claude Debussy.<br />
One of his professors at the conservatory inquired, &#8220;What rules do you observe?&#8221;<br />
Debussy answered, &#8220;None—only my own pleasure!&#8221;<br/>
<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; came the reply, &#8220;provided you&#8217;re a genius.&#8221; They soon began to suspect that he was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Legendary teacher Isidore Philipp offered to introduce the young Hungarian composer Bela Bartok to Camille Saint-Saens, at that time a great celebrity. Bartok declined. Philipp then offered him Charles-Marie Wider. Bartok again declined. &#8216;Well, if you won&#8217;t meet them, who is there that you would like to know?&#8217; &#8216;Debussy,&#8217; said Bartok. &#8216;But he is a horrid man,&#8217; said Philipp. &#8216;He hates everybody and will certainly be rude to you. Do you want to be insulted by Debussy?&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Bartok.&quot;</blockquote>
