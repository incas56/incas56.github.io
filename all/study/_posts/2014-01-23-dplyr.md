When working with data you must:

*Figure out what you want to do.

*Precisely describe what you want in the form of a computer program.

*Execute the code.

The dplyr package makes each of these steps as fast and easy as possible by:

-Elucidating the most common data manipulation operations, so that        your options are helpfully constrained when thinking about how to tackle a problem.

-Providing simple functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation verbs, so that you can easily translate your thoughts into code.

-Using efficient data storage backends, so that you spend as little time waiting for the computer as possible.
